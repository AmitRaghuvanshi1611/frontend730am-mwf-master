static: Default, follows normal flow.

relative: Moves relative to its normal position.

absolute: Positioned relative to the nearest ancestor with a position other than static.

fixed: Positioned relative to the browser window.

sticky: Acts like relative until a scroll threshold, then acts like fixed.
