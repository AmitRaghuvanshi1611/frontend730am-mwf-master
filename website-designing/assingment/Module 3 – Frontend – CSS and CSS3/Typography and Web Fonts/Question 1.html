<!-- Explain the difference between web-safe fonts and custom web fonts. Why might you use a web-safe font over a custom font? -->


<!-- web-safe fonts -->
<!-- Web-safe fonts are fonts that are commonly available across  operating systems and devices Examples include Arial, Times New Roman, and Verdana. They are already-installed on most computers, which means they will render correctly without requiring additional downloads.  -->

<!-- custom web fonts. -->
<!-- Custom web fonts are fonts that are not pre-installed on all devices. They can be downloaded from services like Google Fonts or Adobe Fonts and used on a webpage. Custom fonts allow for greater design flexibility and uniqueness, but they require additional loading time and may not render correctly -->



<!-- most of used web safe fonts becuse it is pre-installed & also web safe font are easily availabe in all device so devloper can not requiers from other  site  downloads and may render correctly -->
