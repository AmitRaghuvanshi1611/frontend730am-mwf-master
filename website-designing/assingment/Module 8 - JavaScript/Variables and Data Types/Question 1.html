What are variables in JavaScript? How do you declare a variable using var, let, and const?

In JavaScript, a variable is a named container used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated in a program. Variables allow you to store values like numbers, strings, objects, arrays, and other — and to reuse or modify them throughout your code.
You can declare a variable in JavaScript using three different keywords: var, let, and const. Each has its own characteristics and use cases:

1. var:
- The var keyword is used to declare a variable that is function-scoped or globally scoped if declared outside a function.
- Variables declared with var can be re-declared and updated.
Example:
var age = 25;
age = 26; // Updating 
var age = 30; // Re-declaring 

2. let:
- The let keyword is used to declare a block-scoped variable, meaning it is only accessible within the block (e.g., inside a loop or an if statement) where it is defined.
- Variables declared with let can be updated but cannot be re-declared within the same scope.   
Example:
let score = 100;
score = 150; // Updating
// let score = 200; // This would cause an error if uncommented


3. const:
- The const keyword is used to declare a block-scoped variable that cannot be reassigned after its initial assignment.
- Variables declared with const must be initialized at the time of declaration and cannot be updated or re-declared.
Example:    
const pi = 3.14;
// pi = 3.14159; // This would cause an error if uncommented
